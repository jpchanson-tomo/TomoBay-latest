<div class="textblock"><p>This project uses the Gradle build system to run build and test functionality as well as handling dependency management.</p>
<p>The choice to use Gradle was based on a couple of factors, chief among these was the use of a system that could easily deal with being used on windows(booo) as well as Linux, as well as the ease of extensibility and the scope of automation possibilities (through Gradle plugins).</p>
<p>This project uses the following gradle plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Java</b> This plugin allows java projects to be manipulated and compiled using Gradle. As Gradle is uses the Groovy language by default, this plugin is integral to allowing the project to be built.</li>
<li><b>Eclipse</b> This plugin is a convenience plugin, as most of the development for this project has been carried out using eclipse this aids in fulfilling certain eclipse based tasks.</li>
<li><b>project-report</b> This plugin allows a project report containing various statistics relating to the health of the project such as: dependencies available gradle tasks and other useful tidbits.</li>
<li><b>org.ysb33r.doxygen</b> This plugin is supposed to interface with the Doxygen documentation automation system and allow the generation of HTML documentation as a gradle task. Currently this functionality does not work, probably due to something stupid i havent done of forgotten, etc ........one day........one day i'll get it right.</li>
<li><b>com.github.samueltbrown.cucumber</b> This plugin allows the use of the cucumber acceptance testing within the project, making it possible to test the web based frontend using a gradle task. Like the doxygen plugin, this one is also currently not working.</li>
</ul>
<p>These plugins have been chosen to try and automate the build, test and documentation procedures for this project allowing for a 'full build' to run all of these procedures in sequence provide test reports as part of the documentation as a 'snapshot' of the current project health as of the last full build.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>As mentioned above I have made as much effort as possible to automate/semi-automate the testing process. Below is more detail about the various testing levels.</p>
<h3>Unit Testing</h3>
<p>Unit testing is implemented with JUnit, unfortunately only newer functionality have unit tests associated with them as the project was not started from a TDD standpoint, the merits of such an approach, however, were discovered towards the end and as such the test covereage of the codebase is lacking. However any new functionality should have tests written first as part of the specifiaction for a particular piece of functionality/class.</p>
<h3>Integration Testing</h3>
<p>A seperate testing framework has not been used for integration testing. Instead JUnit has been integration testing; again like the Unit testing as a TDD approach has not been taken from the start integration tests are currently lacking, however for any new modules integration should be written.</p>
<h3>Acceptance Testing</h3>
<p>Work has been done to integrate the Cucumber Acceptance testing framework into the testing toolchain, the aim being to have Cucumber features written in the <em>Gherkin</em> language and the actual acceptance tests written in <em>Ruby</em>, and the tests launched as a Gradle task via a plugin. Currently however this is a work in progress and Acceptance testing needs to be written and launched manually.</p>
