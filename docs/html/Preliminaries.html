<p>This project uses the Gradle build system to run build and test functionality as well as handling dependency management. The choice to use Gradle was based on a couple of factors, chief among these was the use of a system that could easily deal with being used on windows(booo) as well as Linux, as well as the ease of extensibility and the scope of automation possibilities (through Gradle plugins).</p>
<p>This project uses the following gradle plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Java</b> This plugin allows java projects to be manipulated and compiled using Gradle. As Gradle is uses the Groovy language by default, this plugin is integral to allowing the project to be built.</li>
<li><b>Eclipse</b> This plugin is a convenience plugin, as most of the development for this project has been carried out using eclipse this aids in fulfilling certain eclipse based tasks.</li>
<li><b>project-report</b> This plugin allows a project report containing various statistics relating to the health of the project such as: dependencies available gradle tasks and other useful tidbits.</li>
<li><b>org.ysb33r.doxygen</b> This plugin is supposed to interface with the Doxygen documentation automation system and allow the generation of HTML documentation as a gradle task. Currently this functionality does not work, probably due to something stupid i havent done of forgotten, etc ........one day........one day i'll get it right.</li>
<li><b>com.github.samueltbrown.cucumber</b> This plugin allows the use of the cucumber acceptance testing within the project, making it possible to test the web based frontend using a gradle task. Like the doxygen plugin, this one is also currently not working.</li>
</ul>
<p>These plugins have been chosen to try and automate the build, test and documentation procedures for this project allowing for a 'full build' to run all of these procedures in sequence provide test reports as part of the documentation as a 'snapshot' of the current project health as of the last full build.</p>
<h2>Style Guide</h2>
<ul>
<li>Max line length = 110 chars (guidleine not hard limit)</li>
<li>Tabs or Spaces ..... tabs ALWAYS dufus</li>
<li>curly braces should always be on a seperate line unless the opening brace, closing brace and the enclosed expression can be fit on one 110 char line.</li>
<li>Comment everything</li>
<li>if there is more than one level of nested conditional statements then somethings gone wrong</li>
<li>every class should have a constructor even if it is empty</li>
<li>every constructor should call super() before anything else, even if the super constructor is empty this is a defensive measure and a reminder.</li>
<li>Object Variables should be postfixed with a _M</li>
<li>Static variables should be in uppercase</li>
<li>Casting should be avoided wherever possible</li>
<li>enhanced for loop should be avoided due to it requiring extra overhead.</li>
<li>everything that can be final should be final</li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>As mentioned above I have made as much effort as possible to automate/semi-automate the testing process. Below is more detail about the various testing levels. Following the Gradle convention ...mostly... all tests are located in <a class="el" href="namespacecom_1_1tomoparts_1_1tomoBay_1_1test.html">com.tomoparts.tomoBay.test</a> and its sub packages.</p>
<h3>Unit Testing</h3>
<p>Unit testing is implemented with JUnit, unfortunately only newer functionality have unit tests associated with them as the project was not started from a TDD standpoint, the merits of such an approach, however, were discovered towards the end and as such the test covereage of the codebase is lacking. However any new functionality should have tests written first as part of the specifiaction for a particular piece of functionality/class. The results of the unit tests are automatically placed in the '<em>Project Health -&gt; <a class="el" href="UnitTesting.html">Unit Testing</a></em>'</p>
<h3>Integration Testing</h3>
<p>A seperate testing framework has not been used for integration testing. Instead JUnit has been integration testing; again like the Unit testing as a TDD approach has not been taken from the start integration tests are currently lacking, however for any new modules integration should be written. As the Integration tests are functionally the same as unit tests, the results of these tests get placed in the same place as the unit tests result.</p>
<h3>Acceptance Testing</h3>
<p>Work has been done to integrate the Cucumber Acceptance testing framework into the testing toolchain, the aim being to have Cucumber features written in the <em>Gherkin</em> language and the actual acceptance tests written in <em>Ruby</em>, and the tests launched as a Gradle task via a plugin. Currently however this is a work in progress and Acceptance testing needs to be written and launched manually. The results of the acceptance tests should be placed in the '<em>Project Health -&gt; <a class="el" href="AcceptanceTesting.html">Acceptance Testing</a></em>'</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The documentation is automatically generated from various code artifacts, this is possible due to the wonderful, amazing, beautiful <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen">Doxygen</a>. There aren't enough words to explain how great this documentation generation system is, it can do pretty much everything you could want, and if it doesnt there is usually a way to hack it so that it does.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.plantuml.com">PlantUML</a> is used in combination with this for the production of interactive UML diagrams that can be easily embedded into the documentation. This is also a rather nice feature as the UML diagrams can be specified textually and are compiled and rendered when doxygen is run.</p>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p>Currently I have not been able to get the Doxygen gradle plugin working so Doxygen has to be run manually from the same directory that the doxyfile is in, i.e. '..../projectDirectory/docs/' unless you are using doxywizard; in which case it is possible to just load the doxyfile into doxywizard and it will run fine.</p>
<h3>Style Guide</h3>
<ul>
<li>first comment in a file should be the copyright and licence statement</li>
<li>Class comments should include the @author tag and should describe the general purpose and design of the class.</li>
<li>Every method and variable should be commented and use the following tags: @return &amp; @param(if the method has arguments).</li>
<li>Variables use single line comments of the form '\**this is a variable comment**\' unless there is a real need to explain it in detail, which generally means that there is something wrong with the design or a really poor variable name has been chosen.</li>
<li>unit tests have a special layout @test describes the purpose of the test, @pre describes the preconditions to this test, @post is used to define the behaviour guaranteed by this test passing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>The Build system can be extended through the use of gradle plugins, and by editing the build.gradle file, for more information the <a href="https://gradle.org">Gradle</a> website provides a large number of tutorials that may be useful.</p>
<p>The documentation system can be extended in a number of different ways which are beyond the scope of this document to explain, the <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen">Doxygen</a>. However if you look at the external html sections of the doxyfile and then look in the 'projectRoot/docs/customisations' directory and you'll get an idea of what can be done and how to do it, but seriously, look at the Doxygen page. </p>
